                <div class="paragraph-light left">A 90-year old former scientist sued a publisher for breach of contract for failure to timely publish his book about the history of the Earth, as well as to collect a personal loan made to the owner of the publishing company.<br><br>The Defendant made numerous continuance requests to the Court, making various excuses about why she couldn’t show up. After three court dates, the Judge decided enough was enough and entered a judgment for the full amount owed. The Debtor believed that this was unfair and initially refused to pay, although she had numerous chances to tell her side of the story to the Judge but failed to appear.<br><br>We simply told her that if she failed to pay, we would go after her for the full amount owed and begin selling her property at public auction with the assistance of the Sheriff’s Office. Dejected that we didn’t want to hear any excuses or explanations, the Debtor agreed to make monthly installments to pay the entire judgment amount.</div>

                <div class="paragraph-light left">Judgment for $144K. Debtors failed to repay a commercial loan to purchase a gas station in 2009. Debtors were married and both medical professionals (pediatrician and physical therapist, respectively), both owned their own successful practices with positive online reviews.<br><br>Sheriff levied on debtors’ accounts but only captured about $5 grand. It appeared debtors had substantial IRS and state tax liens against them, encumbering the equity in several pieces of real estate owned in their names. Numerous subpoenas were served to banks and other third parties for financial records. The debtors were hiding money in several corporations and LLCs.<br><br>Wage Execution Orders were issued against these entities requiring the debtors to garnish their own salaries from their medical practices. Unsurprisingly, debtors (who controlled these entities) failed to comply (who would’ve guessed?). This required multiple motions to enter judgment against these entities themselves for failure to comply with the wage garnishment orders.<br><br>After two hearings, the Debtors retained an attorney to attempt to stave off payment, and made numerous excuses for why they ignored the court’s procedures. Fortunately, the Judge was having none of it, and granted judgments against the medical entities for over $176k. Faced with the prospect of Sheriff’s deputies arriving to seize assets, debtors’ attorney offered to settle for $100,000 but this offer was rejected. Several bank account levies were conducted which captured $104,000 from the debtors’ accounts. Debtors agreed to settle the judgment for a total of $155,000.</div>

                <div class="paragraph-light left">Judgment for $345k against an individual in Massachusetts. Debtor had no real estate in his name and appeared to potentially be “judgment proof” at the age of 75.<br><br>We located assets of the debtor and levied upon them, satisfying over $310,000 of the judgment in one fell swoop (If only they could all be this simple). The debtor retained counsel and filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment, arguing that he was never properly served with the underlying Summons and arguing that the person served, his roommate/partner, was “incompetent” to accept service due to medical conditions.<br><br>After conducting extensive research, we uncovered public records showing his partner was actually the President of her Condo Association where they resided! Additionally, the debtor had received ample notice of the lawsuit papers via U.S. Priority Mail with tracking and proof of delivery. The Judge was not impressed, and issued an Order Denying the Debtor’s Motion, leaving the judgment intact and fully enforceable. In view of the Court’s Order, the Debtor settled for over $320k.</div>

                <div class="paragraph-light left">Judgment for $144K. Debtors failed to repay a commercial loan to purchase a gas station in 2009. Debtors were married and both medical professionals (pediatrician and physical therapist, respectively), both owned their own successful practices with positive online reviews.<br><br>Sheriff levied on debtors’ accounts but only captured about $5 grand. It appeared debtors had substantial IRS and state tax liens against them, encumbering the equity in several pieces of real estate owned in their names. Numerous subpoenas were served to banks and other third parties for financial records. The debtors were hiding money in several corporations and LLCs.<br><br>Wage Execution Orders were issued against these entities requiring the debtors to garnish their own salaries from their medical practices. Unsurprisingly, debtors (who controlled these entities) failed to comply (who would’ve guessed?). This required multiple motions to enter judgment against these entities themselves for failure to comply with the wage garnishment orders.<br><br>After two hearings, the Debtors retained an attorney to attempt to stave off payment, and made numerous excuses for why they ignored the court’s procedures. Fortunately, the Judge was having none of it, and granted judgments against the medical entities for over $176k. Faced with the prospect of Sheriff’s deputies arriving to seize assets, debtors’ attorney offered to settle for $100,000 but this offer was rejected. Several bank account levies were conducted which captured $104,000 from the debtors’ accounts. Debtors agreed to settle the judgment for a total of $155,000.</div>

The debtor retained counsel and filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment, arguing that he was never properly served with the underlying Summons and arguing that the person served, his roommate/partner, was “incompetent” to accept service due to medical conditions.<br><br>After conducting extensive research, we uncovered public records showing his partner was actually the President of her Condo Association where they resided! Additionally, the debtor had received ample notice of the lawsuit papers via U.S. Priority Mail with tracking and proof of delivery. The Judge was not impressed, and issued an Order Denying the Debtor’s Motion, leaving the judgment intact and fully enforceable. In view of the Court’s Order, the Debtor settled for over $320k.</div>

After opposing a Claim of Exemption attempting to stop us from collecting the levied monies, we obtained Judgment Debtor Examination Orders requiring the Debtor and his wife to appear in Court to testify about their income and assets. We also filed a Motion to garnish the wife’s earnings as a successful real estate professional.<br><br>Interestingly enough, the debtor was a habitual gambler and had player’s cards at numerous local casinos as well as casinos in Las Vegas. We filed a Motion for Assignment Order of the debtor’s gambling income, to require the debtor to keep an accounting of his gambling winnings and apply these proceeds to the debt.

                <div class="paragraph-light left">Judgment for personal injuries sustained after a custom-made rifle blew apart the first day it was fired, causing injuries to Plaintiff. Gun manufacturer battled bitterly for over one (1) year in a vain effort to avoid payment and spent substantially more than the judgment amount paying attorneys in multiple states to obstruct collection at every time.<br><br>The debtor’s bank account was levied, capturing over $11,000. Debtor retained an attorney and filed a Petition to Open/Strike Judgment, which was rejected by the Judge after strong opposition. Debtor insisted the funds captured from a joint account were actually his daughter’s, but produced no evidence of this, resulting in the Court granting permission to recover these funds. After a Motion to Compel was granted ordering the debtor to disclose all of his assets, the Debtor <em>still </em>failed to comply.<br><br>We went before the Court and this time asked for the Judge to hold the Debtor in Contempt of Court. This too was granted and an Order was issued finding the Debtor in Contempt for his refusal to obey the Court’s instructions. The Debtor was fined $1,000 and ordered to pay ongoing monetary sanctions of $25.00 per day he failed to cooperate with the Court Order. The Judge even threatened to issue a Bench Warrant for the Judgment Debtor’s arrest if he continued his recalcitrant behavior.<br><br>The Debtor mentioned he had spent over $65,000 in attorney’s fees attempting to avoid his debt and decided to just “make this go away”! Realizing the jig was up, the debtor paid the judgment, interest, costs, and monetary sanctions in full, amounting to over $24,000.</div>

Debtor was a auto body shop owner in the Koreatown neighborhood of LA.<br><br>Initially, he refused to pay and told us exactly what we could do with the judgment. After we obtained a Writ of Execution, we sent the LA County Sheriff’s Department into the auto body shop, with instructions to seize everything of value. Four armed Sheriff’s Deputies arrived outside, with a moving truck on standby ready to begin clearing the place out.<br><br>The Sheriffs attempted to convince the Debtor to just pay up to avoid all his goods and equipment inside the shop from being hauled out, to no avail. After an entire moving truck was filled up, we asked the Sheriff to also take the contents of his filing cabinets and office computers, containing our debtor’s customer lists, invoices, accounting books, and job details. The debtor changed his tune, made a few phone calls, and paid the judgment off in full.</div>

                <div class="paragraph-light left">Husband and wife were personally served with the lawsuit by a process server in Florida. They filed a pro se “Answer” which didn’t address any of the Plaintiff’s allegations, which was stricken by the Court and the Defendants given 30 days to file a conforming answer in compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure. Unfortunately, they failed to do so, and received a judgment for $85,000.<br><br>After we got involved and began collection efforts, the Debtor retained a Pennsylvania attorney to challenge the underlying judgment. In doing so, Defendants claimed they didn’t receive approximately thirty (30) pieces of mail sent to their addresses. The Judge found this was not credible and denied their attempt to re-open the judgment. Still refusing to pay, the debtors appealed the Trial Court’s ruling to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The Superior Court, on appeal, affirmed the Trial Court’s order denying relief from the judgment.<br><br>Enforcement efforts remain ongoing to recover the full amount owed.</div>
